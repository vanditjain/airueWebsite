							<h3>ERP</h3>
							<p>Clients today are increasing building robust internal systems that come with certain intrinsic attributes.
							 These are systems that are meant to fit business needs, help optimize costs and are easy to maintain with the
							 lowest possible total cost of ownership. The enterprise system is the nerve centre of the fabric that runs 
							 through the organization. ERP is one of the most accomplished practices within AIRUE INVO. We have added 
							 substantial value to clients through engagements that span from stand alone implementations, regional/ global 
							 roll outs,	upgrades, migration and complex transformation programs that involve significant change management 
							 and technology implementation.
							 <br>
							 Deploying the core comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities that extend to an ecosystem
							 residing within each of our client environments.Typically,once the core ERP system is successfully deployed,
							 our teams extend the engagement to associated applications and integration. We have built unique workflows,
							 industry specific modules all of which integrate to the core ERP application . These systems are built on object
							 oriented and open standards, hence easy to integrate and maintain.</p>

							<h3>BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION</h3>
							<p>In the age of intense competition, organization efficiency and adaptability are not just requirements for 
							success, but also necessities for survival. Enterprises today are exposed to the ever increasing complexity 
							of change and integration. Navigating through those challenges and making the most of opportunities demands 
							that the corporate business and IT initiatives are aligned with overall business objectives. Having a clear 
							assessment of business and technology strategy, developing a roadmap, moving to cloud where it makes sense, and 
							putting the mechanisms in place to deal with future needs is critical to achieving your goals.
							<br>
							Stone Apple Business Transformation experts work with companies to develop a clear strategy and architecture 
							that allows them to shift gears and adapt as priorities change over time. With limited dollars to spend on IT, 
							ensuring correct allocation of investments is essential. Based on years of global, industry experience our consultants 
							have developed industry-specific frameworks and unique approaches to transform IT processes. While every transformation 
							is unique, we apply proven processes and best-in-class practices to address all aspects, determine specific business needs 
							and tailor our services to ensure the stated outcomes. Efficiency and modularity are designed into every service delivery
